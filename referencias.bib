	abstract = {Introduction
Regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (RPNIs) are biological constructs which amplify neural signals and have shown long-term stability in rat models. Real-time control of a neuroprosthesis in rat models has not yet been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to: a) design and validate a system for translating electromyography (EMG) signals from an RPNI in a rat model into real-time control of a neuroprosthetic hand, and; b) use the system to demonstrate RPNI proportional neuroprosthesis control.

Methods
Animals were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: (1) Control; (2) Denervated, and; (3) RPNI. In the RPNI group, the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was dissected free, denervated, transferred to the lateral thigh and neurotized with the residual end of the transected common peroneal nerve. Rats received tactile stimuli to the hind-limb via monofilaments, and electrodes were used to record EMG. Signals were filtered, rectified and integrated using a moving sample window. Processed EMG signals (iEMG) from RPNIs were validated against Control and Denervated group outputs.

Results
Voluntary reflexive rat movements produced signaling that activated the prosthesis in both the Control and RPNI groups, but produced no activation in the Denervated group. Signal-to-Noise ratio between hind-limb movement and resting iEMG was 3.55 for Controls and 3.81 for RPNIs. Both Control and RPNI groups exhibited a logarithmic iEMG increase with increased monofilament pressure, allowing graded prosthetic hand speed control (R2 = 0.758 and R2 = 0.802, respectively).

Conclusion
EMG signals were successfully acquired from RPNIs and translated into real-time neuroprosthetic control. Signal contamination from muscles adjacent to the RPNI was minimal. RPNI constructs provided reliable proportional prosthetic hand control.

The aim of this investigation was to undertake an analysis of the extant literature concerning animal models utilized in the context of RPNIs. A systematic review of the literature of RPNI techniques in animal models was performed in line with the PRISMA statement using the MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase databases from January 1970 to September 2023. Within the compilation of one hundred and four articles employing the RPNI technique, a subset of thirty-five were conducted using animal models across six distinct institutions. The majority (91\%) of these studies were performed on murine models, while the remaining (9\%) were conducted employing macaque models. The most frequently employed anatomical components in the construction of the RPNIs were the common peroneal nerve and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Through various histological techniques, robust neoangiogenesis and axonal regeneration were evidenced. Functionally, the RPNIs demonstrated the capability to discern, record, and amplify action potentials, a competence that exhibited commendable long-term stability. Different RPNI animal models have been replicated across different studies. Histological, neurophysiological, and functional analyses are summarized to be used in future studies.},

Data were collected from 4 forearm muscles when simulating 10 unique hand gestures and recorded with the BIOPAC MP36 device using Ag/AgCl surface bipolar electrodes. Each participant's data contains five repetitive cycles of ten hand gestures. A demographic survey was applied to the participants before the signal recording process. This data can be utilized for recognition, classification, and prediction studies in order to develop EMG-based hand movement controller systems. The dataset can also be useful as a reference to create an artificial intelligence model (especially a deep learning model) to detect gesture-related EMG signals.

	abstract = {Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) is a surgical approach that can produce a neural-machine interface to provide additional electromyography (EMG) signals in intuitive control of myoelectric prostheses for high-level limb amputees. Clinically, TMR interface can be built by two types of surgical protocols. The first surgical protocol is to transfer a residual nerve to a denervated targeted muscle using a nerve-to-muscle suture and another is to anastomose a residual nerve to a targeted nerve via a nerve-to-nerve suture. Currently, it still remains unknown which surgical protocol would be more suitable for their clinical applications. In this study, a comparative investigation of the two TMR protocols was conducted by using animals and their performance in reconstructing EMG signals was evaluated. For nerve-to-muscle animal model, the proximal end of ulnar nerve was implanted onto denervated biceps brachii muscle and for nerve-to-nerve model, the proximal end of ulnar nerve was anastomosed to the distal end of musculocutaneous nerve. Post-surgery EMG signals were collected from all the TMR animals. Our results showed that the amplitudes of EMG signals gradually increased for the animals in the two TMR protocols over time, with an obvious difference between nerve-to-muscle and nerve-to-nerve animals. The signal-to-noise ratio and the centroid frequency of EMG signals in nerve-to-muscle animals were notably higher than those in nerve-to-muscle animals. These superior characteristics of the postoperative EMG signals demonstrated that nerve-to-nerve surgical protocol would be better than nerve-to-muscle in reconstructing EMG signals. The findings of this animal study suggest that both the TMR surgical protocols could be useful in providing additional EMG signals for myoelectric control, while the nerve-to-nerve suture would outperform the nerve-to-muscle suture in the quality and the appearance of the reconstructed extra EMG signals.},

Previous high-density (HD) surface electromyography (EMG) studies have indicated that tremendous neural control information can be extracted from the reinnervated muscles by EMG pattern recognition (PR). However, using a large number of EMG electrodes hinders clinical application of the TMR technique. This study investigated a reduced number of electrodes and the placement required to extract sufficient neural control information for accurate identification of user movement intents. An electrode selection algorithm was applied to the HD EMG recordings from each of four TMR amputee subjects. The results show that when using only 12 selected bipolar electrodes the average accuracy over subjects for classifying 16 movement intents was 93.0 (plusmn3.3)\%, just 1.2\% lower than when using the entire HD electrode complement. The locations of selected electrodes were consistent with the anatomical reinnervation sites. Additionally, a practical protocol for clinical electrode placement was developed, which does not rely on complex HD EMG experiment and analysis while maintaining a classification accuracy of 88.7plusmn4.5\%. These outcomes provide important guidelines for practical electrode placement that can promote future clinical application of TMR and EMG PR in the control of multifunctional prostheses.},

	abstract = {This study presents a novel high density surface electromyography (EMG) decomposition method, named as 2CFastICA, because it incorporates two key algorithms: kernel constrained FastICA and correlation constrained FastICA. The former focuses on overcoming the local convergence of FastICA without requiring the peel-off strategy used in the progressive FastICA peel-off (PFP) framework. The latter further refines the output of kernel constrained FastICA by correcting possible erroneous or missed spikes. The two constrained FastICA algorithms supplement each other to warrant the decomposition performance. The 2CFastICA method was validated using simulated surface EMG signals with different motor unit numbers and signal to noise ratios (SNRs). Two source validation was also performed by simultaneous high density surface EMG and intramuscular EMG recordings, showing a matching rate (MR) of (97.2 ± 3.5)\% for 170 common motor units. In addition, a different form of two source validation was also conducted taking advantages of the high density surface EMG characteristics of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, showing a MR of (99.4 ± 0.9)\% for 34 common motor units from interference and sparse datasets. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that 2CFastICA can achieve similar decomposition performance to PFP. However, the efficiency of decomposition can be greatly improved by 2CFastICA since the complex signal processing procedures associated with the peel-off strategy are not required any more. Along with this paper, we also provide the MATLAB open source code of 2CFastICA for high density surface EMG decomposition.},
