	abstract = {This study presents a novel high density surface electromyography ({EMG}) decomposition method, named as 2CFastICA, because it incorporates two key algorithms: kernel constrained {FastICA} and correlation constrained {FastICA}. The former focuses on overcoming the local convergence of {FastICA} without requiring the peel-off strategy used in the progressive {FastICA} peel-off ({PFP}) framework. The latter further refines the output of kernel constrained {FastICA} by correcting possible erroneous or missed spikes. The two constrained {FastICA} algorithms supplement each other to warrant the decomposition performance. The 2CFastICA method was validated using simulated surface {EMG} signals with different motor unit numbers and signal to noise ratios ({SNRs}). Two source validation was also performed by simultaneous high density surface {EMG} and intramuscular {EMG} recordings, showing a matching rate ({MR}) of (97.2 ± 3.5)\% for 170 common motor units. In addition, a different form of two source validation was also conducted taking advantages of the high density surface {EMG} characteristics of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, showing a {MR} of (99.4 ± 0.9)\% for 34 common motor units from interference and sparse datasets. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that 2CFastICA can achieve similar decomposition performance to {PFP}. However, the efficiency of decomposition can be greatly improved by 2CFastICA since the complex signal processing procedures associated with the peel-off strategy are not required any more. Along with this paper, we also provide the {MATLAB} open source code of 2CFastICA for high density surface {EMG} decomposition.},

	abstract = {Targeted muscle reinnervation ({TMR}) is a novel neural machine interface for improved myoelectric prosthesis control. Previous high-density ({HD}) surface electromyography ({EMG}) studies have indicated that tremendous neural control information can be extracted from the reinnervated muscles by {EMG} pattern recognition ({PR}). However, using a large number of {EMG} electrodes hinders clinical application of the {TMR} technique. This study investigated a reduced number of electrodes and the placement required to extract sufficient neural control information for accurate identification of user movement intents. An electrode selection algorithm was applied to the {HD} {EMG} recordings from each of four {TMR} amputee subjects. The results show that when using only 12 selected bipolar electrodes the average accuracy over subjects for classifying 16 movement intents was 93.0 (plusmn3.3)\%, just 1.2\% lower than when using the entire {HD} electrode complement. The locations of selected electrodes were consistent with the anatomical reinnervation sites. Additionally, a practical protocol for clinical electrode placement was developed, which does not rely on complex {HD} {EMG} experiment and analysis while maintaining a classification accuracy of 88.7plusmn4.5\%. These outcomes provide important guidelines for practical electrode placement that can promote future clinical application of {TMR} and {EMG} {PR} in the control of multifunctional prostheses.},

	abstract = {Targeted Muscle Reinnervation ({TMR}) is a surgical approach that can produce a neural-machine interface to provide additional electromyography ({EMG}) signals in intuitive control of myoelectric prostheses for high-level limb amputees. Clinically, {TMR} interface can be built by two types of surgical protocols. The first surgical protocol is to transfer a residual nerve to a denervated targeted muscle using a nerve-to-muscle suture and another is to anastomose a residual nerve to a targeted nerve via a nerve-to-nerve suture. Currently, it still remains unknown which surgical protocol would be more suitable for their clinical applications. In this study, a comparative investigation of the two {TMR} protocols was conducted by using animals and their performance in reconstructing {EMG} signals was evaluated. For nerve-to-muscle animal model, the proximal end of ulnar nerve was implanted onto denervated biceps brachii muscle and for nerve-to-nerve model, the proximal end of ulnar nerve was anastomosed to the distal end of musculocutaneous nerve. Post-surgery {EMG} signals were collected from all the {TMR} animals. Our results showed that the amplitudes of {EMG} signals gradually increased for the animals in the two {TMR} protocols over time, with an obvious difference between nerve-to-muscle and nerve-to-nerve animals. The signal-to-noise ratio and the centroid frequency of {EMG} signals in nerve-to-muscle animals were notably higher than those in nerve-to-muscle animals. These superior characteristics of the postoperative {EMG} signals demonstrated that nerve-to-nerve surgical protocol would be better than nerve-to-muscle in reconstructing {EMG} signals. The findings of this animal study suggest that both the {TMR} surgical protocols could be useful in providing additional {EMG} signals for myoelectric control, while the nerve-to-nerve suture would outperform the nerve-to-muscle suture in the quality and the appearance of the reconstructed extra {EMG} signals.},

As an alternative, Targeted Nerve Function Replacement ({TNFR}) offers a fundamentally different approach by establishing a direct end-to-end anastomosis between an intact donor nerve and the original nerve of a target muscle, preserving existing neural pathways while providing supplementary neural input. This study evaluates {TNFR} efficacy in restoring denervated muscle function across different postoperative intervals in a rat model.},
